## Agent basde model for Predator-Prey Simulations

Important files:
- `ABM.py`: grid environment and agents for the simulation
- `simulation.py`: the script to run the simulation
- `simconfig.yml`: the yamlfile to configure the simulation, e.g. gridsize etc.

To run a simulation, make sure that `simulation.py` and `simconfig.yml` are in the same directory and that a directory called `plots` exists. Then invoke
```
python3 simulation.py
```
because the simconfig file will be read in automatically.
