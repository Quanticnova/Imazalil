agents:
    - add a (class?)method to return an object, than can easily be stored by
        some IO function

env:
    - literally everything
    - additionally the necessary functions step, reset, .. see gym
    - use collections.ChainMap to create a single map of the agents -> no
        need for handling 2 (or more) dictionaries
    - agent objects can be stored in dicts
    - move the initialization to the agent classes:
        . pass agent class functors to environment
        . pass agent init arguments through Environment
        . remove unneeded properties from environment
