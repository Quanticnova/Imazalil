agents:
    - add a (class?)method to return an object, than can easily be stored by
        some IO function
    - advance the __str__ magic method!

env:
    - exchange all type test decorators with type_check, but handle the missing
      * symbols

plots:
    - masked arrays -> empty cells are white (ma.masked_equal(arr, 0))

 profiler:
    - use one!

simulation:
    - how to store data during runtime? -> with open .....

documentation:
    - cleanup of existing documentation
    - write new documentation for environment

general:
    - cythonize the code?
